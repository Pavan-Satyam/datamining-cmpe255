Preprocessing : 
In table fact_TS_iPASS there are no district name ,I merged them from the 'dim_districts' file. After joining the CSV files, the output is saved as 'mer_iPAss'. I did this to make it easier since reading district names can be a bit difficult, and everyone would be more familiar with them.




Analysis 1:

What are the top districts where most of the money is invested in?

Clearly Rangareddy , Sangareddy, Medchal are the top three districts for investment.

Analysis 2 : 
What if stakeholder needed for different sectors?


I have implemented a dropdown menu for selecting sectors. This allows stakeholders to view individual sectors and identify the top-performing districts in each specific sector. For example, in Electrical and Electronics Production, Sangareddy ranks as the top district.
Analysis 3:
Is there a relation between the Stamps revenue and Investment?
I have calculated a correlation between e-stamps revenue and investments in crores. Initially, we considered data from 2021 onwards and grouped it by date. The correlation between them was found to be 0.77. This suggests that when there is an increase in investment, there is a corresponding increase in e-stamps revenue, and vice versa.

Analysis 4:
Which district had the most revenue in Documents registering?


This is regarding IStamps dataset.I have created a GeoJSON file to depict the evolving financial landscape of Telangana over time. Using distinct colors to denote varying revenue levels, this visualization is hosted on a local server and accessible through Tableau after logging in. Think of it as a time-lapse of the state, showcasing the generated revenue.

This visualization serves multiple purposes. It enables us to grasp revenue trends in Telangana across time, pinpoint regions with high and low revenue, and track the impact of governmental policies and initiatives. Furthermore, it facilitates comparisons between the revenue performance of different districts and regions.


In this visualization, we can observe a significant increase in revenue per district over time, as represented on the timeline.
